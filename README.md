# VidarVoyager
This is a project I'm using to learn libgdx.

If you are going to build this on a PC make sure to comment out the line for macOS in the build.gradle file. It's in the desktop project dependencies section on line 54.

If you want to play the game you can download the VidarVoyager_desktop_main_jar directory and click on the VidarVoyager.desktop.main.jar file. For macOS you might have to open a terminal cd to the directory the jar file is located and run the command 'sudo chmod +x VidarVoyager.desktop.main.jar'. You should be able to click on the jar file to play the game after that.
