# VidarVoyager
Vidar Voyager is a top-down 2d puzzle game that I am currently developing. I am using Libgdx framework and Gradle build tool.

# How to Build
This project will require an android sdk
Please follow the android guide to downloading an android sdk
https://android-doc.github.io/sdk/installing/index.html

Once you have downloaded android studios you will have to change the sdk to Android 31.

Please follow the libgdx setup guide to import and edit the Desktop Launcher build and run configuration

The build should look like this when you are done

# How to Play
There is a jar file located in the out directory. Simply download and double click the file. 
There currently is no puzzle on the main menu. You can click anywhere to continue to the game.
There are no puzzles implemented in the game yet either. Check back soon.
